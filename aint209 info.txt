[Other info]

I hold settings via a iniParser i created, So if anything doesnt work you can edit all settings from the "gameDirectory/data folder/config.ini" (windows)

If you edit Controller or FX settings in the config, these can be reloaded once in level via F5, other settings require restart.

You can also play with current XP and xp settings in XP.ini
